Problem 1. Maximim Index - level medium 
Given an array A of positive integers. 
The task is to find the maximum of j - i 
subjected to the constraint of A[i] <= A[j].

EX1
34 8 10 3 2 80 30 33 1
A[1] = 8
A[7] = 33
therefore the answer is 7-1 = 6

Look at other numbers.
A[0]= 34 that is the max so no bueno.

A[2] = 10 
A[6] = 33
    this proposed answer would be 6-2 = 4.
