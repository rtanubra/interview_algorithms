    1. Replace every element with the greatest element on the right side                   
        Given an array of integers, 
        replace every element with the next greatest element
        (greatest element on the right side) in the array. 
        Since there is no element next to the last element, 
        replace it with -1. For example, 
        if the array is {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, 
        then it should be modified to {17, 5, 5, 5, 2, -1}.

    2. Highest power of 2 less than or equal to given number
                            -COMPLETED
        Given a number n, find the highest power of 2 that 
        is smaller than or equal to n.

    3. Given a binary string, count number of substrings that start and end with 1
                            -COMPLETED
        Given a binary string, count number of substrings that
        start and end with 1. For example, if the input string 
        is “00100101”, then there are three substrings “1001”,
        “100101” and “101”.

    4. Kadane's Algorithm - Medium 
                            -COMPLETED (took the iterative approach)
        Given an array arr of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum

    5.L_I_S Longest Increasing Subsequence - Medium
                            -COMPLETED
        Given a sequence, find the length of the longest increasing 
        subsequence from a given sequence .
        The longest increasing subsequence means to find a subsequence of a 
        given sequence in which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order,
        lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as 
        possible. This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.
